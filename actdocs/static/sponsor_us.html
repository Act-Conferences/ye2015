    <h2>Sponsorship Proposal</h2>
    
    
    <P>
    YAPC::Europe is the biggest conference in Europe, dedicated to the Perl programming language and its community.
    </p>
    <p>
    The event takes place from September 2-4 in Granada, Spain. The Venue that we have selected is ETSI Informática y Telecomunicación (University of Granada).
    </p>
    <p>
    The conference also attracts attendees who are interested in agile development methods, testing, project management, user interface design, text processing, creating compilers, and those who are following modern trends of computer languages.
    </p>
    <p>
    We are glad to propose you becoming a sponsor of our conference.
    </p>
    <p>
    The companies becoming a sponsor always attract the attendees as a potential employer. It also works for the long term; the logotypes and company names become more recognizable and more Perl-friendly if they were seen at the Perl language conference.
    </p>
    This proposal contains information about the conference itself and lists advantages and possibilities for the sponsors.
    </p>
    
    <h3>The YAPC::Europe Conference</h3>
    <p>
    YAPC::Europe is the largest annual European conference and is hosted in a different city every year. It is aimed toward programmers, companies and freelancers who use the Perl programming language. The conference provides attendees with a deeper understanding of Perl, its philosophy, and the opportunity to learn the latest features and techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
    YAPCs (Yet Another Perl Conferences) have been held since 1999 and now include: YAPC::NA (North America), YAPC::Asia, YAPC::Brasil, YAPC::Russia and YAPC::Europe. Despite their obvious primary geographical structure, people from around the world attend each conference.
    </p>
    <p>
    The European conference, YAPC::Europe, moves between European countries. In 2015 the conference moves to Granada, Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
    There are usually around 300 attendees at YAPC::Europe, with 60–80 speakers. The speakers include those who are responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of Perl itself. Talks are held in parallel, with 3-4 talks for each time slot. Tutorials and classes are also held during the conference or immediately following it. They are held by well-known stars and are dedicated to deeper and more specific Perl details and applications. The conference language is English.
    </p>
    <p>
    One of the key principles behind YAPC conferences is the minimal price for the attendees. The role of sponsors is so important because YAPCs are not commercial events. To make a grassroots conference like YAPC::Europe happen, we need money. If you want to give something back to the Perl community and support us, we would be happy to welcome you as a sponsor.
