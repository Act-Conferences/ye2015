        <li><p>Courses will take place on September 1st. If you need more days, send us an email.</p></li>
        <li><p>Courses have to be related to Perl in some way.</p></li>
        <li><p>We have six classrooms reserved with capacities ranging from 15 to 40 seats. If you need more, please tell us.</p></li>
        <li><p>All the classrooms have a high-definition projector; some of them also have a whiteboard.</p></li>
        <li><p>You can propose half-day  (3.5h) or full day (7h) courses.</p></li>
        <li><p>Instructors will be able to set the price for their courses at their
            discretion; however, experience from previous conferences show that
            those prices usually range between 150€ and 200€ for a full day
            course; however, that includes meals and coffees which will <em>not</em> be
            included in this case). The organization will charge a minimum of
            150€.</p></li>
        <li><p>The organization of the conference will take care of the student payments through the Act platform. </p></li>
        <li><p>For every course the organization will charge a 15% overhead to cover processing and administrative costs. </p></li>
        <li><p>Instructors will be paid by the conference organization upon
            presentation of an invoice. Educational services carry a 0% VAT in
            Spain so if your account manager is OK with that, we have no problem.</p></li>
        <li><p>We will accept proposals for courses in English and in
            Spanish. Currently, our intention is to have a full-day course on
            modern Perl in Spanish and the rest of the courses in English, but
            we will consider other proposals for courses in Spanish anyway. </p></li>
        <li><p>It is up to the instructor to decide the minimum amount of students needed to actually give the course. </p></li>
