        <li><strong>Instructor:</strong> Dave Cross
            <ul>
                <li>Dave has been using Perl since 1996 and in that time has worked for

                <li>Dave is the author of "Data Munging with Perl" (Manning, 2001) and a co-author of
                    "Perl Template Toolkit" (O'Reilly, 2003). He is a regular speaker at

                <ul>
                    <li>You will learn how to use DBIx::Class to make it far easier to write code that talks to databases.</li>

    Using DBIx::Class makes interacting with a database far easier.</li>
                    <li>We'll look at how you create the classes you need to use DBIx::Class with a database,

    to make your life even easier.</li>

                    <li>There will be no practical sessions, so a laptop will not be necessary (but might be useful for taking notes).</li>
