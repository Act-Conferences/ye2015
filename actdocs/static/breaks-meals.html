    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong id="preconf">Eligo pizza</strong> will be delivered on Tuesday, 1 of September. Our sponsor <a href="http://eligo.co.uk/">Eligo</a> will invite all registered persons to pizza and drinks, from 19:00 to 21:00, at the <a href="/ye2015/venue.html#plano-ciencias">Conference venue's patio</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong id="coffee-breaks">Coffee-breaks</strong> are scheduled for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday at 10:30 and 16:30, taking no more than 30 minuntes. They will be served next to the rooms where the talks will take place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong id="lunches">Lunch time</strong> will start every day at 13:00, lasting 90 minutes, and are sponsored by <a href='http://booking.com'>Booking</a>.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>
       Lunch is organized as a <em>tapas crawl</em>, since Granada is well-known for the ancient tradition of complementing your drink (in bars and cafes) with a small (and sometimes not so small) amount of food (the <em>tapa</em>). We have reached an agreement with several bars sorrounding the Conference venue that will accept <em>Coinions</em> (the "official" Conference's coin) as the way to pay for your drink and its associated tapa. These bars will be well marked and menus will be in English.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, when registering yourself at the Conference's registration desk, you will get 18 <em>Coinions</em>, divided into 9 tickets. So, feel free to spend them as you prefer, probably visiting the different bars associated with this initiative. You can spend them any time of the day, any day during the conference.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, we'll provide a list of the bars where <em>Coinions</em> are accepted, including their locations.
    </p>

    <P>
      Finally, the <strong id="conference-dinner">Conference Dinner</strong> will take place on Wednesday (2 of September), 21:00 hours, at <a href="http://act.yapc.eu/ye2015/wiki?node=Hotel%20Los%20Angeles">Hotel Los Angeles</a>. This dinner is included in your registration, but <a href="http://act.yapc.eu/ye2015/purchase">you can buy addtional tickets for your guests</a>.
