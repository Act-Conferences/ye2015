		<p>
        I have been around Ruby on Rails since 2005.
		I am a member of the Rails core team, and the author of Rails Contributors.
	   	Also honored to have been presented a Ruby Hero Award in RailsConf 2010,
	   	and to be part of the team who organised the European Ruby Conference 2009
	   	(EuRuKo 2009), held in Barcelona.
		</p>
		<p>
        I was also into Perl for some years.
		I am a CPAN author, and former leader of Barcelona.pm.
		Back in 2006 I published an article about the intricacies of newlines for O'Reilly's ONLamp.com.
	   	Also taught a Perl semester for seven years at the University of Barcelona as a part-time lecturer.
		That was vocational, I did it in my spare time.
