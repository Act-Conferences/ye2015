    <h2>Panel: Growing the Perl community - taking the challenge </h2>
    <p>
    Perl developers are hard to find.
  </p>
  <p>
  You might think it's nice having recruiters chase you down the street waving bank notes, but think again. Many companies avoid starting a new project in Perl because it will be hard to find people to maintain it in the long term. If it stays like this, you'll have to change career (or at least your language).
</p>
<p>
  In this talk we'll discuss why the community is dwindling and what we can do to reverse that trend. Each member of the panel takes 5 minutes to present themselves and their background, talk about the obstacles they see to the growth of the Perl community, and discuss any solutions they have in mind.
</p>
<p>
  The remainder of the session will take questions from the audience.
